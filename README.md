# FreeGwent

A Work-In-Progress. This is a port of the game "Gwent" from the Witcher 3.
If you enjoyed that game, you may enjoy the much better standalone version
from the same company: (https://www.playgwent.com/en).

## Motivation

This started as an excuse to learn more about Unity, and spiralled out of
control from there.

## To-Do

This is not yet playable. First thing to do is to get the game into a playable,
"complete" state. Then, address a number of known user-interface bugs and
improvements, and increase server-side validity checks on moves. Some time will
also need to be poured into debugging the WebGL build, which often fails for
unknown reasons. Finally, more fanciful things could be added, such as
remembering your deck between games, and card animations when cards are moved
around.
